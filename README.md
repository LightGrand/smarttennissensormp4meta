Smart Tennis Sensor - example code for mp4 meta data parsing

This an example Android application that locates mp4 files recorded by the Smart Tennis Sensor and extracts the user defined sensor data from them. This assumes the files have been downloaded onto the tablet under the folder /SmartTennisSensor/. The metadata is located in a uuid box in XML format. 
To run, download the application onto the same device in which the mp4 files are stored. 

Please see Smart Tennis Sensor MP4 Meta Data Whitepaper.pdf and Smart Tennis Sensor MP4 Meta Data Sample Code.pdf for the detail.
